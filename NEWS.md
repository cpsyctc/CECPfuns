# Version 0.0.0.9021
Trying to get continuous integration testing on github with github actions running.

# Version 0.0.0.9021
Added classifyRCIfromScores() which at first seemed a trivial function, 
it is really, but it turned into a huge amount of work bizarrely.
Added internal data directory data-raw for test data and hence
sysdata.rda.  Some R style improvements.

# Version 0.0.0.9020

I have skipped updating here through 12 changes.  The 9000 came
in as it's a convention that says the version is alpha/testing.
Latest change was adding classifyRCIfromScores() and a lot of
tweaking and trying to improve lint checking complaints.

# Version 0.0.0.8

Added getCSC() and some more tweaks to documentation and help.

# Version 0.0.0.7

Improved documentation, building README.Rd from README.Rmd just by 
knitting it in Rstudio.
