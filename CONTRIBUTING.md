At the moment (April 2021) CECPfuns is largely my work with some advice from Clara and Emily.  
If you would like to contribute to the project that sounds good to me but please observe the
code of conduct and bear in mind that I am essentially self-taught both in statistics and in
programming so you may want to be gentle with me if you see things that look mad to you!

I am absolutely as keen to have input to the documentation as to the code so if you have 
suggestions do create an issue or contact me using https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/contact-me/

Thanks,

Chris Evans
