The goal driving the creation of CECPfuns is largely selfish: to make sure I have a single, up to date, repository where I can find potentially reusable functions I have written.  However, it is something that has been very much encouraged by 
(Dr. Clara Paz)[https://investigacion.udla.edu.ec/udla_teams/clara-paz/] and she has contributed to some of these functions and to the general
idea of the package.  Input has also come from (Emily Blackshaw)[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2].  It is possible that 
these functions may be of use to others so I am now uploading it to GitHub at https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns after any significant changes. 

There is also now a pkgdown produced web site for the package at https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of CECPfuns from https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns.  

To get it with the vignettes use one of these instructions within R.

``` r
devtools::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = TRUE)
### or
remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

However, that may fail with a complaint if you don't have pandoc installed on your machine as R uses pandoc to build vignettes.  You can install it following the instructions at https://pandoc.org/installing.html.  I would then close and reopen R (just in case it needs to find pandoc) and then repeat one of the above instructions.  Alternatively, you can install it without the vignettes using one of the following.

``` r
devtools::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = FALSE)
### or
remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

If you really want to make sure you always have the latest version, you can look for it every time you launch R, see [here](https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/posts/2021-02-10-making-my-first-usable-package/#how-i-am-synching-my-package-to-machines-other-than-my-main-machine).

## Background information

* As above, you can find out more about Clara at https://investigacion.udla.edu.ec/udla_teams/clara-paz/,
* you can find out more about Emily at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2 and about her PhD which I am supervising on ResearchGate, 
[here]( https://www.researchgate.net/project/Young-Persons-Clinical-Outcomes-in-Routine-Evaluation-YP-CORE-Scale-psychometric-properties-and-utility) and
* my own biggest research programme, which overlaps with Emily's work, is the CORE system: https://www.corestemtrust.org.uk/ and a web site about my non-CORE work is slowly building (from a much earlier one) at https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/ and my personal site is https://www.psyctc.org/pelerinage2016.
