Title: Package of Utility Functions Created by Chris Evans and Clara Paz
Version: 0.0.0.8
Author: Chris Evans
Maintainer: Chris Evans <chris@psyctc.org>
Description: This should evolve into a repository of all the functions that I (CE)
  and Clara Paz (CP) have created (so far only CE!) and tested enough to
  want to store here where we will know we can always find the latest
  versions.  Very much work in progress now.
