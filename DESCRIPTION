Title: Package of Utility Functions for Psychological Therapies, Mental Health and Well-being Work (Created by Chris Evans and Clara Paz)
Version: 0.0.0.9037
Maintainer: Chris Evans <chris@psyctc.org>
Description: This should evolve into a repository of all the functions that I (CE)
  and Clara Paz (CP) have created (so far only CE!) and tested enough to
  want to store here where we will know we can always find the latest
  versions.  Please check the MIT licence for disclaimer.
