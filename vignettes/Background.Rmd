If you haven't seen it already, you can find an introduction to the package in the Introduction vignette. You should be able to get to that with this.

## Background

The primary goal driving the creation of CECPfuns was selfish: to have a single repository of my functions that I could keep up to date and where I could easily find the latest version of any potentially reusable functions I have written. My first public posting about the package is [here](https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/posts/2021-02-10-making-my-first-usable-package/).

Two of my colleagues, Dr. Clara Paz and Emily Blackshaw have encouraged me to think that this might become something of use for others and I am now very much working toward that aim and, with that in mind I have put the package on GitHub at https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns.  

## Who are we?

* You can [find out more about Emily here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2) and about her PhD, which I am supervising, at her [ResearchGate project page](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Young-Persons-Clinical-Outcomes-in-Routine-Evaluation-YP-CORE-Scale-psychometric-properties-and-utility).
* My own sites are:
  + my biggest research programme, which overlaps with Emily's work, the CORE system at https://www.coresystemtrust.org.uk/
  + a [web site about my non-CORE work](https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/), which I am slowly (re)building from a much earlier one
  + my ["R blog" or "SAFAQ"](https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/) as I have called it  of pages created using R and the [distill package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)
  + pages which relate to a book, co-authored with Jo-anne Carlyle, coming out in autumn 2021: watch this space!
  + my [personal site](https://www.psyctc.org/pelerinage2016).
