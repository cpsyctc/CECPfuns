# Background

``` r
library(CECPfuns)
```

If you haven’t seen it already, you can find an introduction to the
package in the Introduction vignette. You should be able to get to that
with this.

## Background

The primary goal driving the creation of CECPfuns was selfish: to have a
single repository of my functions that I could keep up to date and where
I could easily find the latest version of any potentially reusable
functions I have written. My first public posting about the package is
[here](https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/posts/2021-02-10-making-my-first-usable-package/).

Two of my colleagues, Dr. Clara Paz and Emily Blackshaw have encouraged
me to think that this might become something of use for others and I am
now very much working toward that aim and, with that in mind I have put
the package on GitHub at <https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns>.

## Who are we?

  here](https://investigacion.udla.edu.ec/udla_teams/clara-paz/).
- You can [find out more about Emily
  here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2) and about
  her PhD, which I am supervising, at her [ResearchGate project
  page](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Young-Persons-Clinical-Outcomes-in-Routine-Evaluation-YP-CORE-Scale-psychometric-properties-and-utility).
- My own sites are:
  - my biggest research programme, which overlaps with Emily’s work, the
    CORE system at <https://www.coresystemtrust.org.uk/>
  - a [web site about my non-CORE work](https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/),
    which I am slowly (re)building from a much earlier one
  - my [“R blog” or “SAFAQ”](https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/) as I have
    called it of pages created using R and the [distill
    package](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/)
  - pages which relate to a book, co-authored with Jo-anne Carlyle,
    coming out in autumn 2021: watch this space!
  - my [personal site](https://www.psyctc.org/pelerinage2016).
