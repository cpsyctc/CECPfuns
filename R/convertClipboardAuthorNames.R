#'
#' ### You copy that into the system clipboard and in an interactive R session you run:
#' convertClipboardAuthorNames()
#'
#' ### That default will try to rearrange the names to its limited extent, print a warning to you
#' ### and put the rearranged names back into the clipboard replacing what was there.
#'
#' ### It's way away from intelligent, hence by default it gives you a warning.
#' ### An example of things it can't handle is 'Arni, S.R.' in the above.
#' ### That is already in the format we want so the function will mess that
#' ### one up: always check the result after pasting it into Zotero (or wherever).
#' ### Nevertheless I think the function now saves me time despite its lack of intelligence.
#' ### I hope it does for you too.
#'
#' ### If you are fed up with the warning you can use:
#' convertClipboardAuthorNames(warn = FALSE)
#'
#' ### I can't think why but just in case you want the result to be returned to the R prompt
#' ### as a character vector and NOT copied back to the clipboard, use:
#'
#' convertClipboardAuthorNames(toClipboard = FALSE)
#' }

#' @section Background:
#' This is a tiny and crude function to convert a number of 'Firstname Familyname' lines
#' on the clipboard to 'Familyname, Firstname'.  I wrote it because I was quite often
#' putting records into Zotero where I had a list of authors but in that
#' 'Firstname Familyname' format and I thought it would save me time to have this to do
#' a first, rough, conversion to 'Familyname, Firstname' which Zotero will then
#' suck in happily.
#'
#' Beware, this is crude, as the default warning say, it will mess up space separated
#' family names like 'Matte Blanco' splitting that to make 'Blanco' alone the family name.
#' It must also fail if there is a mix of ordering in what you feed it and in some other
#' messy challenges.  So always check what it has put in the clipboard.  However, I find
#' it helps me quite a lot of the time. But then I pretty well always have Rstudio open
#' and the CECPfuns package loaded so it's quick and easy for me to call.  As the geeks say
#' your mileage may vary!",
