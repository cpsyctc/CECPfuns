#' @aliases NULL CECPfuns-package
#' @details
#'
#' The goal driving the creation of CECPfuns is largely selfish: to make sure I have a single,
#' up to date, repository where I can find potentially reusable functions I have written.
#' However, it is something that has been very much encouraged by (Dr. Clara Paz) and she has
#' contributed to some of these functions and to the general idea of the package.
#'
#' Input has also come from Emily Blackshaw <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2>.
#'
#' It is possible that these functions may be of use to others so I am uploading it regularly after
#' any significant changes to GitHub at <https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns>.
#'
#' # General resources
#' *  As above, you can find out more about Clara at <https://investigacion.udla.edu.ec/udla_teams/clara-paz/>.
#' *  You can find out more about Emily at <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2>
#'   and about her PhD which I am supervising on ResearchGate,
#'   [here](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Young-Persons-Clinical-Outcomes-in-Routine-Evaluation-YP-CORE-Scale-psychometric-properties-and-utility)
#' * My own sites are:
#'   + my biggest research programme, which overlaps with Emily's work, is the CORE system:
#'   <https://www.corestemtrust.org.uk/>
#'   + a web site about my non-CORE work which I am slowly (re)building from a much earlier one is
#'   at <https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/> and
#'   +  my personal site is <https://www.psyctc.org/pelerinage2016>.

#' * Add getBootCIRCIfromItemData()
#' * Add getBootCIMeanDiff()
#' * Add getHedgesg() (currently an empty file)
#' * Add getCohend() (deal with "-2")
#' * Add getCohendPaired()

#' * then perhaps some functions for standard reports from (fairly) standard CORE datasets (should feed separate Rmd templates)
