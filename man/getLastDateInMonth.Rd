This uses ceiling_date function from the lubridate package

\section{Background}{

I found it convenient to be able to get the first and last dates for the month
of a date when mapping between dated data and data from months.

It's easy to get this using the ceiling_date() function from the lubridate package.
ceiling_date() actually gives you the first date in the next month so I just
subtract one day from that date.

I thought about writing the function to handle character dates but decided it
was more sensible to restrict to dates but use the example to remind people
how to convert from character/text format to date format

\examples{
### this shows that the function is vectorised, i.e. can handle a vector of dates
### and that it handles leap years correctly
### (of course both are true: it's basically reusing function from lubridate package!)
getLastDateInMonth(as.Date(c("15/02/1975",  "15/02/1976"), format = "\%d/\%m/\%Y"))
### [1] "1975-02-28" "1976-02-29"
