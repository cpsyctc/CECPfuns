\title{Function outputting a plot of confidence interval around a correlation for a range of sample sizes}
\usage{
plotCIPearson(
  corr,
  minN,
  maxN,
  step = 1,
  conf = 0.95,
  minY = NULL,
  maxY = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr}{numeric: Pearson correlation}

\item{minN}{numeric: the smallest n for which you want the CI}

\item{maxN}{numeric: the largest n for which you want the CI}

\item{step}{numeric: the step by which you want n to increment (default is 1), with minN and maxN should give no more than 200 values of n}

\item{conf}{numeric: the confidence interval you want, defaults to .95}

\item{minY}{numeric: if you want to set the y axis limits input a number greater than -1 here}

\item{maxY}{numeric: if you want to set the y axis limits input a number smaller than 1 here}
}
\value{
a ggplot object so if you don't capture it it will plot to your default plot device

\description{
Function outputting a plot of confidence interval around a correlation for a range of sample sizes
}
\section{Background}{

This is another function like \code{\link{plotBinconf}} which plots the width of confidence
intervals (CIs) for a range of sample/dataset sizes.
}

\section{History/development log}{

Version 1: 5.iv.21
Version 2: 25.xi.23 Renamed to plotCIPearson to allow for addition of plotCISpearman soon.

\examples{
\dontrun{
### simple example for observed 95\% confidence interval (CI) around observed correlation of .7
### for sample sizes between 10 and 100
plotCIPearson(.7, 10, 100)

### similar but for dataset sizes between 10 and 500 by steps of 5
plotCIPearson(.7, 10, 500, 5)

### similar but asking for 99\% CI
plotCIPearson(.7, 10, 500, 5, conf = .99)

### similar but setting lower y axis limit to -1
plotCIPearson(.7, 10, 500, 5, conf = .99, minY = -1)

### and you can set the upper y limit, observed R = 0 for a change
plotCIPearson(0, 10, 500, 5, conf = .99, minY = -1, maxY = 1)

### same but exporting to tmpPlot and then changing plot
plotCIPearson(0, 10, 500, 5, conf = .99, minY = -1, maxY = 1) -> tmpPlot
tmpPlot +
   ggtitle("95\% CI around observed Pearson correlation of zero for n from 10 to 500") +
   theme_bw()
