\title{Function that takes a p value and returns the s value (Shannon entropy, surprisal value)}
\usage{
getSvalFromPval(pVal, dp = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{pVal}{observed p value}

\item{dp}{number of decimal places required for corrected R}
}
\value{
numeric: s value
}
\description{
This uses the trivial calculation that converts a probability to its s value
}
\section{Background}{

This is basic information theory.  For more information, see:
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)}{wikipedia entry}
The formula is simple:
\loadmathjax{}

\mjdeqn{s=-log_{2}(p)}{s = -log(p) where log is to base 2}

There are strong arguments for expressing the value of new findings in terms of this s value
rather than a p value (or a confidence interval though I do think they are better than p values!)

An s value is the unexpectedness (hence \emph{surprisal}) of a finding against some model.  An s value of
sausages
1 will not change your information or expectations at all so if you toss a coin many times and the
rate of it coming down heads (or tails) is .5 then the s value is 1 (-log(.5, base = 2)) and your
expectation that the coin is fair is unchanged.

However, if you toss the coin four times and you predicted heads and saw heads the probability of
this if the coin is fair is .5^2 = .0625 and the s value is 4 so you may be starting to feel that
the hypothesis that the coin is fair is going down (it is!).  The s value of information is the
same as that of getting the side you wanted that many times tossing a fair coin.  That is arguably
easier to understand than a p value or a confidence interval and its a continuous measure not a
very arbitrary cutting point as a null hypothesis test is.

For what it is worth the s value of p = .05 is 4.322.

Started 31.viii.25.
Tweaked 6.ix.25 vectorizing the function.

\examples{
getCorrectedR(.3, .7, .7)
### should return 0.428571428571429
### yes, that's a silly number of decimal places!

### return an s value for p = .05 to three decimal places
getSvalFromPval(.05, 3)
### should return 4.322

### return s value for throwing four heads in a row when you wanted heads
getSvalFromPval(.5^4, 3)
### should return 4 which is pretty much the definition of what an s value is, see background

### the function is vectorised so can handle a vector of p values:
getSvalFromPval(c(.5, .05, .01, .005, .001))
### should return 1.000 4.322 6.644 7.644 9.966
