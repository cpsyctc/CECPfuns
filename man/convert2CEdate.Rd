Function to convert Dates to my date format strings

\section{Background}{

I like to write dates in the format dd.mm.yyyy but doing the months, mm,
in Roman numerals, i.e. i = January, xii = December.  This, unless someone
has never met the Roman's weird numbering system seems always to promote
initial bemusement but then recognition and I've never had anyone say
"but why not use Roman numerals for the days?" so I think it does disambiguate dates.
It is a trivial function and perhaps I'm the only person who will ever use it but here it is.
It expects input as a Date and can handle a vector of dates.

\examples{
date1 <- as.Date("1/1/2021", format = "\%d/\%m/\%Y")
convert2CEdate(date1)
date2 <- as.Date("2/1/2021", format = "\%d/\%m/\%Y")
dates12 <- c(date1, date2)
convert2CEdate(dates12)
