\section{Background}{

The empirical cumulative distribution function is an
alternative to the histogram to show the distribution
of a set of scores.  It plots the proportion of the
sample set of scores below any observed score against
that score.  The proportion (or percentage) is plotted
on the y axis and the score on the x axis.  It's
particularly useful for our typical mental health (MH)
change/outcome measures as we're interested in how where
someone's score lies in a possible population distribution
of scores.

ECDFs complement quantiles as a quantile (a.k.a. centile,
percentile, decile), is the score (on that x axis) that
maps the percentage, so for the 95\% percentile that
percentile is the score that only 5\% of the sample scored
above, and 95\% scored below.

This function takes a set of scores/values and plots their
ECDF with the quantiles you ask for with their confidence
intervals of the width that wanted (typically 95\%, i.e. .95).

See the help page for getCIforQuantiles() to learn more about
the computation of the confidence intervals.

\dontrun{
### will need tidyverse to run
library(tidyverse)
### will need quantileCI to run
### if you don't have quantileCI package you need to get it from github:
# devtools::install_github("hoehleatsu/quantileCI")
library(quantileCI)

### define the quantiles you want
### here I'm going for the 5th, 10th, 90th and 95\% (per)centiles and the quartiles and median
vecQuantiles <- c(.05, .1, .25, .5, .75, .9, .95)

### looking at 100 scores from 1 to 100
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = 1:100, vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8,
                     titleJust = 1, # right justify the title and subtitle
                     themeBW = TRUE) # use theme_bw()

### same data
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = 1:100, vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8,
                     titleJust = .5, # centre the title and subtitle
                     themeBW = TRUE)

### same data
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = 1:100, vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8,
                     titleJust = .5, themeBW = FALSE,
                     printPlot = FALSE, # this time don't plot from within the function call but
                     ## this next argument ask the function the plot object
                     returnPlot = TRUE) -> tmpPlot
### so plot it! (plot() and print() will both work,
### you can also manipulate the plot before printing)
print(tmpPlot)

### this illustrates the CIs getting tighter as the dataset size goes up
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = 1:1000, vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8)

### and even more data, tighter CIs again
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = 1:10000, vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8)

### now a Gaussian ("Normal") distribution of scores
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = rnorm(100), vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8)

### larger dataset
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = rnorm(1000), vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8)

### and larger again
plotQuantileCIsfromDat(vecDat = rnorm(10000), vecQuantiles = vecQuantiles,
                     method = "N", ci = 0.95, R = 9999, type = 8,
                     titleJust = .5, themeBW = TRUE)
