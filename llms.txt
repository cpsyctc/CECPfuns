# CECPfuns

The goal driving the creation of CECPfuns is largely selfish: to make
sure I have a single, up to date, repository where I can find
potentially reusable functions I have written. However, it is something
that has been very much encouraged by (Dr. Clara Paz)\[
<https://investigacion.udla.edu.ec/udla_teams/clara-paz/>\] and she has
contributed to some of these functions and to the general idea of the
package. Input has also come from (Emily
Blackshaw)\[<https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2>\].
It is possible that these functions may be of use to others so I am now
uploading it to GitHub at <https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns> after
any significant changes.

There is also now a pkgdown produced web site for the package at
<https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/>.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of CECPfuns from
<https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns>.

To get it with the vignettes use one of these instructions within R.

``` r
devtools::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = TRUE)
### or
remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

However, that may fail with a complaint if you don’t have pandoc
installed on your machine as R uses pandoc to build vignettes. You can
install it following the instructions at
<https://pandoc.org/installing.html>. I would then close and reopen R
(just in case it needs to find pandoc) and then repeat one of the above
instructions. Alternatively, you can install it without the vignettes
using one of the following.

``` r
devtools::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = FALSE)
### or
remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

If you really want to make sure you always have the latest version, you
can look for it every time you launch R, see
[here](https://www.psyctc.org/Rblog/posts/2021-02-10-making-my-first-usable-package/#how-i-am-synching-my-package-to-machines-other-than-my-main-machine).

## Background information

- As above, you can find out more about Clara at
  <https://investigacion.udla.edu.ec/udla_teams/clara-paz/>,
- you can find out more about Emily at
  <https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emily_Blackshaw2> and about her
  PhD which I am supervising on ResearchGate,
  [here](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Young-Persons-Clinical-Outcomes-in-Routine-Evaluation-YP-CORE-Scale-psychometric-properties-and-utility)
  and
- my own biggest research programme, which overlaps with Emily’s work,
  is the CORE system: <https://www.corestemtrust.org.uk/> and a web site
  about my non-CORE work is slowly building (from a much earlier one) at
  <https://www.psyctc.org/psyctc/> and my personal site is
  <https://www.psyctc.org/pelerinage2016>.
